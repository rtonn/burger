# Burger Time!


## Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The user may eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
